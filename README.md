This repo contains multiple smaller HTML/CSS projects aimed at learning particular UI design patterns using responsive design. Where possible, I've kept the JS to a minimum. 

Patterns implemented so far:
1. Responsive flex-box-based blog/website page
2. Responsive masonry(pinterest)-style photo gallery
